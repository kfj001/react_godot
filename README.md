# React & Godot Visualizer App Demo
This is a demo of a basic React application with a 3D graphics visualizer tool written using Godot engine and published as a webassembly program included with the React app.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Change into the project directory**: Navigate to the `sources/react/my-react-app` directory.
2. **Install dependencies**: Run `npm install` in your terminal to install all required dependencies.
3. **Start the demo**: Type `npm start` to build and run the demo.

Once you've completed these steps, you should see the React app running in your default web browser. You can then explore the app's features and modify the code as needed.

## API
